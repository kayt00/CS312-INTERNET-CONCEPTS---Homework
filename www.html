	<h3>HTTP & HTML</h3>
	<p> 
            	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer data over the web. 
	    It is part of the Internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for 
	    transmitting webpage data. HTTP uses a server-client model.
		The original HTTP proposal by Tim Berners-Lee was designed with simplicity in mind as 
	    to help with the adoption of the World Wide Web. The work on turning HTTP into an official 
	    IETF Internet standard proceeded in parallel with the documentation effort around HTTP/1.0 
            and happened over a period of roughly four years: between 1995 and 1999. HTTP/2 is the first 
	    new version of HTTP since HTTP 1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997. The HTTP/2 
	    specification was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015.
	</p> 
	<p>
	    	Hypertext Markup Languag (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web 
	    browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and 
	    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
	    page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
		HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, 
	    which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and it was widely used 
	    and a very successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which on 28 October 2014 
	    was released as a W3C Recommendation, bringing the specification process to completion.

	<h3>World Wide Web Consortium</h3>
	
		The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, 
	    a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and 
	    Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.
		The W3C has a protocol process similar to that of ISOC, where the web community first sends them a 
	    Request For Comments (RFC) about current protocols or the idea of a new one. Then a proposal is drafted 
	    for the requsted web protocol and sent back to the community. The community will then draft the protocol, 
            and next the W3C makes comments and suggestions for the drafted protocol. Lastly, a final draft of the 
	    protocol is created and thus implemented.
		A variety of W3C groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, 
	    guidelines, and supporting materials.
