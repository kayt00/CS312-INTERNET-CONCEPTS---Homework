# CS312-INTERNET-CONCEPTS---Homework02

In this assignment I developed a website that provides information on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This website also provides a form to sign up for my email subsciption list. Once submitted, the form saves the user's subscription information to a text file.
